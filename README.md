### Polling Data
The polling data consists of several polls (uniquely identified by poll_id) conducted by pollsters. Each pollster is associated with a poll_wt and grade, which reflect the confidence in the poll results conducted by them. The raw poll counts reflect the actual results of the poll, while the adjusted polls are the forecasts made by http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com using one of its three models (this is the type column). For more details on attributes, see this page.
